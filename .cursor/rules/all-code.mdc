# Diagnostic Code Guidelines

- For single console.log statements, add the comment at the end of the same line: `console.log('message'); // AI-generated diagnostic`
- For blocks of diagnostic code, add the start/end comments on separate lines before and after the block:
  ```
  // AI-generated diagnostic - start
  console.log('message1');
  console.log('message2');
  // AI-generated diagnostic - end
  ```
- Always clean up ALL diagnostic code when issue is resolved
- Never modify core test functionality when adding diagnostics
