# Diagnostic Code Guidelines

- Only mark temporary debugging code with the diagnostic comment
- Permanent error logging or system monitoring logs should NOT be marked as diagnostic
- For single, temporary diagnostic console.log statements, add the comment at the end of the same line: `console.log('message'); // AI-generated diagnostic`
- For blocks of temporary diagnostic code, add the start/end comments on separate lines before and after the block:
  ```
  // AI-generated diagnostic - start
  console.log('message1');
  console.log('message2');
  // AI-generated diagnostic - end
  ```
- Always clean up ALL diagnostic code when issue is resolved
- Never modify core test functionality when adding diagnostics

## When to mark code as diagnostic:
- Temporary logs added to debug an issue that will be removed once the issue is fixed
- Test outputs that are not meant to be permanent
- Temporary variable dumps or state inspections

## When NOT to mark code as diagnostic:
- Error handling logs that should remain in the codebase
- Production monitoring and logging code
- Exception tracking or reporting
